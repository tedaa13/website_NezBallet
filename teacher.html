                  I was born on 20th December 2004, and I started Ballet at 5. I am a very cheerful girl. I would hop on my bed and sing some random songs. My father used to dance with me when I was still a little girl. In kindergarten, I attend ballet class where Miss Agnes is the teacher. Once I graduate from kindergarten, I stop dancing. After a while, I heard from Miss Agnes that she's opening her own Ballet School. From then on, I started Ballet until now.
                  <br> <br>
                  I got dancing as talent from both of my family sides, even if my parent didn't know how to dance. I heard from my grandfather from my mom's side that he used to dance and perform in front of the Dutch. And i sometimes saw one or two pictures of my mom dancing. I also got my artistic talent from my father's side.
                  <br> <br>
                  I love to perform in front of many audiences, but I also feel nervous even if I have practiced a lot. I'm always so excited every time we would make a gala recital, and my favorite one is when Nez Ballet School collaborates with Able Ballet. It was one of many memories I would like to remember. We went to Cirebon to practice now and then. It was honestly very exhausting but enjoyable. It was time to say goodbye to our dear friend at some point. We cried and hugged. It was such a blast. I hope I can see them again sometime in the future.
                   <br> <br>
                  I gain a lot of experience from workshops and classes that I attend with my classmates. I learn a lot of new skills and ways to improve myself. I also get to meet many talented and beautiful people on the way. I have been friends with many people with different personalities in my ballet class. Even if some quit and I get to meet new people who joined, we aim for the best. We won't know how we will be in the future, but I hope for a bright future. It was a lot of fun dancing all these years, and I don't plan to quit. I would love to dance Ballet with my friends, and of course, I would love to do another ballet recital.
